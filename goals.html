        Pass this course with more than basic understanding of the what this
        course entails.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete basic Computer Courses as well as most of it not all of Gen Ed.

        Move on to a job in my field and on to my future career as a Web

      <p>
        (Degre Program)COMPUTER SCIENCE - AS.CSC<br />from when I first started
        in High School. I've taken CIS 101/201, CIS 120, CIS130, and now I'm
        currently taking CIS 150 and CIS 131.<br />I've also completed HST 120,
        COM 105, MTH 130, and this taking MTH 131 and BIO 100.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm taking this class because in my first Web Dev course there was many
        moments where I felt nothing but pure joy with coding. I knew going in
        this is the path I want to take on life, but CIS 130 set this plan in
        stone. It's no longer I want to be a Web Designer, it's now I WILL be a
        Web Designer.
